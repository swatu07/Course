Algorithm Analysis: 
      It is the process of evaluating algorithms based on various metrics such as time complexity, space complexity, and scalability. 
It helps in understanding the efficiency and performance of different algorithms and selecting the most suitable one for a specific problem.

Divide and Conquer Algorithms: 
      This is a technique in algorithm design where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved independently, and then combined 
to obtain the final solution. Common examples of divide and conquer algorithms include Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

Dynamic Programming: 
      Dynamic programming is a method used to solve problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and storing the results 
of these subproblems to avoid redundant computations. It is particularly useful for optimization problems where you need to find the best 
solution among multiple possible solutions. Classic examples of dynamic programming algorithms include Fibonacci sequence calculation 
and the Knapsack problem.
